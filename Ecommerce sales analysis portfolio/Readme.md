# E-Commerce Sales Analysis (SQL Portfolio Project)

## Overview
This project explores a synthetic e-commerce company's sales data using SQL.  
The goal is to extract actionable business insights related to revenue, customer trends, and product performance.

I created and queried three realistic datasets using SQL: `customers`, `orders`, and `products`.
