Key Findings
Finding 1: High Customer Concentration Risk
Summary: Top 3 customers account for 30% of total revenue, indicating high customer concentration risk.
Evidence: Customer order analysis shows significant revenue concentration among a small customer base, with the highest-value customer contributing over $1,300 in annual revenue.

Confidence Level: High - Direct calculation from transaction data
Finding 2: Regional Performance Disparity
Summary: East region significantly outperforms other regions in both order volume and total sales.
Evidence: Regional analysis reveals uneven market performance across the four geographic regions, with clear leaders and underperformers.
Business Impact: Indicates opportunities for targeted regional marketing and potential resource reallocation to underperforming markets.
Confidence Level: High - Comprehensive regional transaction analysis
Finding 3: Discount Strategy Shows High Adoption
Summary: 72.5% of customers utilize discounts, suggesting strong price sensitivity in the customer base.
Evidence: Discount usage analysis shows majority of orders include promotional pricing rather than full-price purchases.
Business Impact: High discount adoption may indicate pricing optimization opportunities or need to reassess base pricing strategy.
